====================
|sl| has come full circle — twice. Here’s a basic timeline of how it evolved:

* `Ryan Hileman`_ released the `sublimelint`_ plugin for Sublime Text 2.
* `Germán Bravo`_ forked sublimelint, added features, and released it as |sl|.
* `Aparajita Fishman`_ rewrote the |sl| linter architecture and added more features.
* `Jake Swartwood`_ picked up the torch and did a lot of great work maintaining and extending SublimeLinter.
* Sublime Text 3 (ST3) arrived. SublimeLinter needed some work; it didn’t run on ST3, and had some serious architectural problems that were making maintenance difficult.
* Jake and Aparajita talked about what to do, and approached Ryan about merging sublimelint and SublimeLinter. Ryan pointed out the fantastic `ST3 version of sublimelint`_ he had done.
* Aparajita took one look at that code and realized it was a **way** better foundation for a new ST3 version of SublimeLinter than the existing SublimeLinter codebase.
* Realizing how big the task was, Aparajita solicited donations to fund the development of SublimeLinter 3. The SublimeLinter community responded!
* Aparajita `forked the sublimelint ST3 branch`_ and spent two months rewriting SublimeLinter to be better, faster, much easier to use, much easier to configure, and much easier to extend than the previous version.
* `Blake Grotewold`_ took over lead development of |sl| 3 after Aparajita's decided to resign from the project.

Special thanks to the main developers and all those in the community who contributed code or money to make |sl| 3 possible!
